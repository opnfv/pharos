Pharos Templates and Configuration Files
****************************************

Lab and POD templates are provided to help lab owners document capabilities, configurations and
network topologies. Compute, network and storage specifications with network topology details are
required to help developers use lab resources efficiently while minimizing support needs. This also
greatly assists with troubleshhoting. It is the responsibility of the lab owner to keep individual
lab documents updated and determine appropriate level of detail that is exposed publically through
the Wiki or maintained in a secure Pharos repo with controlled access.

While human readable configuration files are needed, the goal is for full automation of deployments.
This requires a common machine readable format for POD configurations as input to every installer.
This is the "POD inventory" common format file.
