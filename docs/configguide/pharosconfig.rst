Pharos Configuration
********************

OPNFV development, test and production activities rely on Pharos resources and support from the Pharos community. Lab
owners and Pharos project committers/contributors will evolve the vision for Pharos as well as expand lab capabilities
that are needed to help OPNFV be highly successful.

Pharos configuration documents provide information on how to setup hardware and networks in a Pharos compliant lab. Jira
is used to track Pharos activities including lab operations. PODs are connected to Jenkins and generally available 24/7
other than scheduled maintenance and troubleshooting. Lab resources are declared as either for *Development (bare-metal
or virtual)*, *Production latest (bare-metal)* or *Production stable (bare-metal)*
