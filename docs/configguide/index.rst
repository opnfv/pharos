Pharos Configuration
********************

OPNFV development, test and production activities rely on Pharos resources and support from the
Pharos community. Lab owners and Pharos project committers/contributors will evolve the vision for
Pharos as well as expand lab capabilities that are needed to help OPNFV be highly successful.

Pharos configuration documents provide information on how to setup hardware and networks in a Pharos
compliant lab. Jira is used to track Pharos activities including lab operations. PODs are connected
to Jenkins and generally available 24/7 other than scheduled maintenance and troubleshooting. Lab
resources are declared as either for *Development (bare-metal or virtual)*, *Production latest
(bare-metal)* or *Production stable (bare-metal)*
