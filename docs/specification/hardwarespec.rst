Pharos compliant environment
----------------------------

A pharos compliant OPNFV test-bed provides:

- One CentOS 7 jump server on which the virtualized Openstack/OPNFV installer runs
- In the Brahmaputra release you may select a variety of deployment toolchains to deploy from the jump server.
- 5 compute / controller nodes (`BGS <https://wiki.opnfv.org/get_started/get_started_work_environment>`_ requires 5 nodes)
- A configured network topology allowing for LOM, Admin, Public, Private, and Storage Networks
- Remote access as defined by the Jenkins slave configuration guide

Hardware requirements
---------------------

**Servers**

CPU:

* Intel Xeon E5-2600v2 Series
(Ivy Bridge and newer, or similar)

Local Storage Configuration:

Below describes the minimum for the Pharos spec,
which is designed to provide enough capacity for
a reasonably functional environment. Additional
and/or faster disks are nice to have and may
produce a better result.

* Disks: 2 x 1TB + 1 x 100GB SSD
* The first 1TB HDD should be used for OS & additional software/tool installation
* The second 1TB HDD configured for CEPH object storage
* Finally, the 100GB SSD should be used as the CEPH journal
* Performance testing requires a mix of compute nodes that have CEPH(swift+Cinder) and without CEPH storage
* Virtual ISO boot capabilities or a separate PXE boot server (DHCP/tftp or Cobbler)

Memory:

* 32G RAM Minimum

Power Supply Single

* Single power supply acceptable (redundant power not required/nice to have)
