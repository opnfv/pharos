Objectives / Scope
-------------------

The Pharos specification defines the OPNFV hardware environment
upon which the OPNFV Brahmaputra platform release can be deployed
on and tested. This specification defines:

- A secure, scalable, standard and HA environment
- Supports the full Brahmaputra deployment lifecycle
(this requires a bare metal environment)
- Supports functional and performance testing of the
Brahmaputra release
- Provides mechanisms and procedures for secure remote
access to the test environment

Deploying Brahmaputra in a Virtualized environment is possible
and will be useful, however it does not provide a fully
featured deployment and test environment for the Brahmaputra
release of OPNFV.

The high level architecture is outlined in the following diagram:
