Objectives / Scope
-------------------

The **Pharos Specification** defines a hardware environment for deployment and testing of the **Brahmaputra**
platform release. The **Pharos Project** is also responsible for defining lab capabilities, developing
management/usage policies and process;  and a support plan for reliable access to project and release resources.
Community labs are provided as a service by companies and are not controlled by Pharos however our objective is
to provide easy visibility of all lab capabilities and their usage at all-times.

Pharos lab infrastructure has the following objectives:
- Provides secure, scalable, standard and HA environments for feature development
- Supports the full Brahmaputra deployment lifecycle (this requires a **bare-metal** environment)
- Supports functional and performance testing of the Brahmaputra release
- Provides mechanisms and procedures for secure remote access to Pharos compliant environments for OPNFV community

Deploying Brahmaputra in a Virtualized environment is possible and will be useful, however it does not provide a fully
featured deployment and realistic test environment for the Brahmaputra release of OPNFV.

The high level architecture is outlined in the following diagram:
