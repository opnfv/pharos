Remote Management
------------------

Remote access is required for â€¦

  * Developers to access deploy/test environments (credentials to be issued per POD / user)
  * Connection of each environment to Jenkins master hosted by Linux Foundation for automated deployment and test

OpenVPN is generally used for remote however community hosted labs may vary due to company security rules. For POD
access rules / restrictions refer to individual lab documentation as each company may have different access rules
and acceptable usage policies.

Basic requirements:

  * SSH sessions to be established (initially on the jump server)
  * Packages to be installed on a system (tools or applications) by pullig from an external repo.

Firewall rules accomodate:

  * SSH sessions
  * Jenkins sessions

Lights-out management network requirements:

  * Out-of-band management for power on/off/reset and bare-metal provisioning
  * Access to server is through a lights-out-management tool and/or a serial console
  * Refer to applicable light-out mangement information from server manufacturer, such as ...

    * Intel lights-out `RMM <http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/server-management/intel-remote-management-module.html>`_
    * HP lights-out `ILO <http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/ilo/index.html>`_
    * CISCO lights-out `UCS <https://developer.cisco.com/site/ucs-dev-center/index.gsp>`_

Linux Foundation Lab is a UCS-M hardware environment with controlled access *as needed*

    * `A list of people <https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/pharos/Lf+Support>`_ with access is maintained on the Wiki
