Pharos Compliance
-----------------

The **Pharos Specification** defines a hardware environment for deployment and testing of the
**Brahmaputra** platform release. The **Pharos Project** is also responsible for defining lab
capabilities, developing management/usage policies and process;  and a support plan for reliable
access to project and release resources.  Community labs are provided as a service by companies and
are not controlled by Pharos however our objective is to provide easy visibility of all lab
capabilities and their usage at all-times.

Pharos lab infrastructure has the following objectives:
- Provides secure, scalable, standard and HA environments for feature development
- Supports the full Brahmaputra deployment lifecycle (this requires a **bare-metal** environment)
- Supports functional and performance testing of the Brahmaputra release
- Provides mechanisms and procedures for secure remote access to Pharos compliant environments for
  OPNFV community

Deploying Brahmaputra in a Virtualized environment is possible and will be useful, however it does
not provide a fully featured deployment and realistic test environment for the Brahmaputra release
of OPNFV.

The high level architecture is outlined in the following diagram:
