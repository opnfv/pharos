Pharos Compliance
-----------------

The **Pharos Specification** defines a hardware environment for deployment and testing of the
OPNFV platform release.

Pharos lab infrastructure has the following objectives:

- Provides secure, scalable, standard and HA environments for feature development
- Supports the full Euphrates deployment lifecycle (this requires a **bare-metal** environment)
- Supports functional and performance testing of the Euphrates release
- Provides mechanisms and procedures for secure remote access to Pharos compliant environments for
  OPNFV community

Deploying Euphrates in a Virtualized environment is possible and will be useful, however it does
not provide a fully featured deployment and realistic test environment for the Euphrates release
of OPNFV.

The high level architecture is outlined in the following diagram:
