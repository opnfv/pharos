      "message": "This looks similar to what I proposed some time ago and got NACKed :)\n1. use salt-formula friendly acronyms (s/db/dbs/;s/tel/mdb/)\n2. IPs are always consecutive in the static model, and I think this is a limitation we can easily impose, allowing an even more compact representation (each line can be described by 3 factors: has vip, start addr, count;\n3. I would not change the IPs and instead require at least net prefix mgmt/24, pxe/24(or 25), private/24, public/26 in IDF.\n4. This is not the place for these values. They should be easily changeable (ideally overrideable from IDF) by end-users. Not sure where they should go though ..",
