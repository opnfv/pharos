PHAROS
======

Pharos is the OPNFV Lab Infrastructure project.

The **Pharos Project** deals with developing an OPNFV lab infrastructure that is geographically and technically diverse.
This will greatly assist in developing a highly robust and stable OPNFV platform. Community labs are hosted by 
individual companies and there is also an OPNFV lab hosted by the Linux Foundation that has controlled access for key 
development and production activities. The **Pharos Specification** defines a "compliant" deployment and test 
environment. Pharos is responsible for defining lab capabilities, developing management/usage policies and process;  
and a support plan for reliable access to project and release resources. Community labs are provided as a service by 
companies and are not controlled by Pharos however our goal is to provide easy visibility of all lab capabilities 
and their usage at all-times.
